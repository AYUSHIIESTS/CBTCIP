ndian Premier League (IPL), Indian professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league that was established in 2008 and has developed into one of the richest sports leagues in the world. The brainchild of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the Indian Premier League (IPL) is based on a round-robin group and knockout format and has teams in major Indian cities.
Matches generally begin in late afternoon or evening so at least a portion of them are played under floodlights at night to maximize the television audience for worldwide broadcasts. Initially, league matches were played on a home-and-away basis between all teams, but, with the planned expansion to 10 clubs (divided into two groups of five) in 2011, that format changed so that matches between some teams would be limited to a single encounter. The top four teams contest three playoff matches, with one losing team being given a second chance to reach the final, a wrinkle aimed at maximizing potential television revenue. The playoff portion of the tournament involves the four teams that finished at the top of the tables in a series of knockout games that allow one team that lost its first-round game a second chance to advance to the final match.
